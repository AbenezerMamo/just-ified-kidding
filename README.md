Bruh

It's back!

1. Left the lone star girl stranded like a DNA
2. Real silent G; like being well spoken was never allowed
3. Nice to meet you, I'm optimist's crime
4. No average cabbage, knees weak - spread, unread - flamed up ticker, take home bread 
5. Causing sickness like Teff. One is good bacteria and the other is a bad exterior causing mass hysteria like a class act filmed in your front lawn
7. My humility
8. The 50k+ students who accepted a C in like the 3rd problem set in a class teaching C
9. Getting pointers from a text book
10. Taking advantage of my home boy to pit him against Uncle Sam & brainwash idiologies of freedom and liberty to advance dark money untaxed XoXo
11. He didn't sleep with your girl on Valentine's. He was doing the ladies a favor. Yeah he pissed me off too.
12. No Rolls Royce deals for a rapper yet because they aleady Ghost wrote the whip
13. Slipped once so i split with her like Adam after she ribbed me the wrong way. Also on splits: tell kids you don't need to split crypto....you can already buy pieces of the asset. That's kind of the point behind stacking Sats...(Thanks Walter & kid!)
14. Rich people who are afraid to go to 0...wtf is the point of being rich then?
15. Black owned != Black Backed != Majority Ownership
16. Sipped up all my favorite liquidity. Called it a milk shakedown.
17. Feeling lucky but left out with no pals in my tier because the only 1 with 7 type game
18. Savage, the only essence of man. Musk couldn't produce musketeers so he cought a Tusk case
19. I would shoot for a Toyota brand deal but it won't be the first time I'd be going places I don't belong
20. Barcodes going out of style
21. Fearing assymetric wins for people out of fear they may bring us closer to flying cars, getting rid of diseases, & increasing the global longevity and prosperity in stylish innovation. How do we get to the sci-fi version of the future? Oh, just magically appear there with all of the old fart technology and ways of thinking; without any winners along the way that build and transition us there; and certainly by retaining control and iron grip on change, its enablers, and all of those who benfit from it. Society: you are backwards; get a clue 
22. What did she do? Broke the heart of God's favorite kid so she can go find a suitable partner to ask a Church for God's blesssing for her marriage so she may have a fruitful partnership in God's honor to produce children that could one day grow up to be model citizens of the world and generate bountiful blessings to share and spread God's grace, forgiveness, and blessings. This one gave me so much peace that I have rid myself of that * entirely in heart, mind, and soul. God's sense of humor is truly a blessing for me hahaa
23. What did they do? Rob him of the indepdent thinking, creative freedom, and intellectual courage so he can't champion it for the kids they so desire and reasssure will be rewarded when they grow up. In 3 lines, I just helped you calibrate your compass better than Apple's pervasive use of location and data in iOS. Disable data for Clock or I'll sue. Thanks.
24. Soup or salad? Nah, I'll get kryptonite greens instead - thanks. Dressing? I'm good; I can see right through
25. Thinking I would ever "let the b.s. get past me". Everybody [TBD] Abe soon to feature you in your very own episode narrated by Kevin Hart. Just gotta make sure he outlives me bc the team needs material and every moment is precious 
26. Thinking Hollywood would ever be allowed to make a penny on my name. In God bro, earnest.
27. Locking eyes with women and wondering why they all hate me
28. All the rich homies who insult a $38B market cap by getting every color but the sexy red. PSA: Alpha Romero & Masserratiiiii may be more than what meets the eye. Right Hyundaiiii & yota? Tsk tsk tsk
29. Teck Decks & model rocket engines - my childhood
30. Goodbye the following:
30. Punk rock, Real Madrid, TF2, Archer, weird corners of the internet, computer science, & everything and anything talent. I'll ruin it all. All of it. Pay back is a b.
31. Rowing. Grit. Changing locations.
32. Baseball. All of it.
33. Drowning in Chanel 30.
34. Everything that is managing fruit stands.
35. If your father is a pastor, stay away from me please.
36. M
37. Killing Floor
38. "Have I told you what me and my girl are doing this weekend" for everyone else
39. Those ads that light my day; anyday
40. Women who think it's funny to play games with me when I was a sweet young price. Now I'm an @; a *; a greeen candel; a thicc whiccc
41. Hello: My balls just popped; can you help me replace them?
42. Stick up the fine gram. Called in the igloot
43. Pike's peek. From my head to my heel toe. I can't even shift dawg. I like my speed in one gear. Trying to boost me a GT engine too. Just the tires i can't a Ford
44. Soft stick and a hardly spoken. Inverted power moves. Omh that's unholy of me.

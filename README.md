Bruh

It's back!

1. Left the lone star girl stranded like a DNA
2. Real silent G; like being well spoken was never allowed
3. Nice to meet you, I'm optimist's crime
4. No average cabbage, knees weak - spread, unread - flamed up ticker, take home bread 
5. Causing sickness like Teff. One is good bacteria and the other is a bad exterior causing mass hysteria like a class act filmed in your front lawn
7. My humility
8. The 50k+ students who accepted a C in like the 3rd problem set in a class teaching C
9. Getting pointers from a text book
10. Taking advantage of my home boy to pit him against Uncle Sam & brainwash idiologies of freedom and liberty to advance dark money untaxed XoXo
11. He didn't sleep with your girl on Valentine's. He was doing the ladies a favor. Yeah he pissed me off too.
12. No Rolls Royce deals for a rapper yet because they aleady Ghost wrote the whip
13. Slipped once so i split with her like Adam after she ribbed me the wrong way. Also on splits: tell kids you don't need to split crypto....you can already buy pieces of the asset. That's kind of the point behind stacking Sats...(Thanks Walter & kid!)
14. Rich people who are afraid to go to 0...wtf is the point of being rich then?

19. I would shoot for a Toyota brand deal but it won't be the first time I'd be going places I don't belong
20. Barcodes going out of style
21. Fearing assymetric wins for people out of fear they may bring us closer to flying cars, getting rid of diseases, & increasing the global longevity and prosperity in stylish innovation. How do we get to the sci-fi version of the future? Oh, just magically appear there with all of the old fart technology and ways of thinking; without any winners along the way that build and transition us there; and certainly by retaining control and iron grip on change, its enablers, and all of those who benfit from it. Society: you are backwards; get a clue 
22. What did she do? Broke the heart of God's favorite kid so she can go find a suitable partner to ask a Church for God's blesssing for her marriage so she may have a fruitful partnership in God's honor to produce children that could one day grow up to be model citizens of the world and generate bountiful blessings to share and spread God's grace, forgiveness, and blessings. This one gave me so much peace that I have rid myself of that * entirely in heart, mind, and soul. God's sense of humor is truly a blessing for me hahaa
23. What did they do? Rob him of the indepdent thinking, creative freedom, and intellectual courage so he can't champion it for the kids they so desire and reasssure will be rewarded when they grow up. In 3 lines, I just helped you calibrate your compass better than Apple's pervasive use of location and data in iOS. Disable data for Clock or I'll sue. Thanks.
24. Soup or salad? Nah, I'll get kryptonite greens instead - thanks. Dressing? I'm good; I can see right through
25. Thinking I would ever "let the b.s. get past me". Everybody [TBD] Abe soon to feature you in your very own episode narrated by Kevin Hart. Just gotta make sure he outlives me bc the team needs material and every moment is precious 
26. Thinking Hollywood would ever be allowed to make a penny on my name. In God bro, earnest.
27. Locking eyes with women and wondering why they all hate me
28. All the rich homies who insult a $38B market cap by getting every color but the sexy red. PSA: Alpha Romero & Masserratiiiii may be more than what meets the eye. Right Hyundaiiii & yota? Tsk tsk tsk
29. Teck Decks & model rocket engines - my childhood
30. Goodbye the following:
30. Punk rock, Real Madrid, TF2, Archer, weird corners of the internet, computer science, & everything and anything talent. I'll ruin it all. All of it. Pay back is a b.
31. Rowing. Grit. Changing locations.

34. Everything that is managing fruit stands.
35. If your father is a pastor, stay away from me please.
36. M
37. Killing Floor
38. "Have I told you what me and my girl are doing this weekend" for everyone else
39. Those ads that light my day; anyday
40. Women who think it's funny to play games with me when I was a sweet young price. Now I'm an @; a *; a greeen candel; a thicc whiccc
41. Hello: My balls just popped; can you help me replace them?
42. Stick up the fine gram. Called in the igloot
43. Pike's peek. From my head to my heel toe. I can't even shift dawg. I like my speed in one gear. Trying to boost me a GT engine too. Just the tires i can't a Ford
44. Soft stick and a hardly spoken. Inverted power moves. Omh that's unholy of me.
45. This kid named Justin Der leading the youth. No joke I thought I was being trolled. Like, here I am on my stool thinking I'm doing social good enabling and kids out here serving it on a platter. Cheesy as sh*t but damn, good on you kid. I'm taking notes. Aye!
46. Me venturing out into the world trying to be Denice the Mennace and mayham as a havoc to society but ending up stumbling into opportunities to make the system better. Like wtf. Then slapped with the moral libra to either watch the world burn since I'm technically on vacation or to just do the social good equivlant of your cat across the hall locking eyes with you at the edge of the table with its pawn partially clasping the glass cup. With every breath you take and every fiber in your muscles clentching and relaxing, the glass just....*thomp* The paws hit the table in a Spacey CoD double tap. "Real meat *". Your jaws drop. The glass is shattered. So is your ego. The cat's stomach grumbles and you see the belly fat roll as it retreats back into its natural posititon and stretches forward with its @ hanging in the aid. *meow*. It rattles its body left and right in a fast pace - inching closer and closer to your still face. *lick* See, that only took 3 days. "Build a better habit - or you'll be the habitat." As it scurries away from your ear, you're simply left wondering how handsome Abe must be but why he's paid many pennies :)
47. (continued) Got people in the agency jelous I have so much agency and Gen Z thinking I'm agent Z but really I'm trying to cc my zzz
48. (continued) Optimist's crime - must have passed and just missed me - "saddest story ever told"
49. Girl who I'm determined to upset by striking out all her favorite players. Wait, wrong sport. A for effort. 5/5 like I'm Ab
50. c but Alkaline (to help her wash down candy shots)
51. To add or not to add. The sub zero substantive issue that is the cover in and out of the money - but never f*ck around money.
52. They say the greatest cars are all about hitting the break - not even gassed up
53. People talking b.s. about how stimulating I am because I'm Ethiopian - rich, black, and from the mother land. We gave you coffee; don't be disrespectful.
54. In other news, Ethiopian world star exports elevator music that is a hit your bed rock can't miss any shells on - to the left - and even - to the right!
55. "Attitude like * you - pay me" - feeling animated; like a car tune; v8 engine block - black boxed like a carton; hitting heel toe slides and dancin like Carlton; and bleedin fuel like a SR-71 canteen. I can't even. Chasing this money like "Katniss Everdeen" with world class talent that could be J.D. certified. "Stand up on the hood if it's that reel; dawg!"
56. * @ kids in Silicon Valley that can't even ship while my homies accepting charges and still putting out content even NPR is raveing about. "1st to the 1st". Black excellence is about to get redefined in our era bruh
57. Stack it up; and it's the strong start to the week
58. Don't wanna find out how fire smart my skull is; rascal with fiscal fixation; risk managed but Cat9 unhinged; utilize all my Howey to pipe all my C notes with Shear will of viscocity; WO but no woes for my varsity game all alone la carte for all the clicques in my city; move that chasity for the manacity; big Walter knocks for the Mitty blimp dream that gives her limp with full service creamed de crop both lips like a hot pick; round after round; relapse for her final lap; gluten to my wake up and never test me like a make up; in the room with hands out and hands like Ayeee for her A
59. Why can't you serve justice to bratty kids of French diplomats? Because their ple deal came with a Sil vu plais
60. How do you ensure diplomatic immunity doesn't run past its 5 year course? Give them a 4 year vest and throw them off a cliff
61. Which embassy gets the worst hospitality? The one Paris Hilton adores
62. Why am I comfortable being the #2 African entrepenuer? They ususally let the true African win the auction. Breaking race divisions because Elon can't be comfortable saying the N word. I say winning isn't everything but it's a good thing the prized winner is where real Negus come from. 3rd place? Always homies with them just in case I gotta tap em in. Never finish first is my kind of game and you know that's why Elon's got so many divorces. The other guy who was 1st for a while got rekt by splitting up his check probably by the same dude who helped him incorporate it. *imaginary hair flip* I was told one of these Negus might grow up to be businessmen that could one day not just rival the best but leave them in the dust. Truly, I'm #1 but I price them out of the market efficently by racing to 0, where it counts. One is pissed that I'm scared of the light and the other wishes I had to fear my * pics would get leaked. Though all 3 of us belive in taking it to the grave b/c the 1% people giving away 99% seem kinda sketch. The one who stayed at the top the longest still can't manage to give more than 1% without...nvm. Well read now firing up the Kindle for all their silly cons as their race to build the valley on Sandy Hill. Damn. Damn. Damn. Wondering why they don't wana be friends? One rejected my scholarship application. The other rejected me on the 1st round as a PM. The other is just salty I rejected AWS for SNAP money to cash in my Snapple facts. The one who dispises me the most invites me to interview for Sr. PM positions with his execs just to fail me on the leadership question: "describe a situation in how you resolved conflict with a teammate." But really they're all pissed they couldn't hire the 1 PM who can lead without influence or authority. Binded my own port but can't complain that my IP never got hurt. Lastly, one smiled for trying to get laid. The other is too obsessed with smiling. The other is pissed that the other clown can smile but he's forced to hide his runoff schemes under "Senator...." :) Literally, can't even come close. How did I pay it forward for all the lessons they helped me escape? Antagonize them. Day after day after day. I'm good where I'm at. Wei Good but never tried to weigh what's good. The other is in your neighborhood and the other can't even tell you what's under the hood and the real gentlemen got there with intel under the hood. *whew*
63. Feenin left out; bites all right
64. Tatt'd up swivel; fed up with the greens from my estate; inner joint and db spiked with hashes until its cached up to ashes and the primary kief in case the job need brief
65. Fair split. Forgot why but it added up at some point
66. 00113636 smile but the hi didn't live down so the grievances remained distant for all to meet her in every instance; real tense - never passed. Wasn't fair but never is for @ present who can't catch on to the assymetry - weight heavy for all those who dispised, tons
67. New day; fresh cent; now trying to copp the whole 30's; get my CD to play me DiViDends; and my quarters to be in the 1st quartile
68. Money looking triangle and makes that sound too because I'm tired of Square & Circle running the game. It ain't friendly so I need you to sign the check on this X here. I long for that short squeeze (carry the Ez please) baby
69. Minted
70. I like my valuation in ex ante change
71. Hi sir, we've got a notice - act fast!
72. Cup
73. The longest and worst day falling on a month I hate. Albeit another day would be same old day unchanged like the first dime and the last dim
74. "1 shy of a quarter a week" and $1 a month to defeat all the others
75. Like a money teller; owned and operated but never coin operated
76. What do you call two habits that stick? A habitat for two
77. Saying it's O & O but you still owe the investors
78. Realizing your GitHub project is just a Twitter text export. It's not * talking if there's no time stamp next to it
79. Reaching the point in life where you look around and realize you too are stuck in the 80s
80. A intro class in getting to the Chapo port
81. Wondering if history teachers get shook when Civil Rights chapter begins and wonder why everyone's looks like they're ready to shiver and derails the class about their weekend
82. To prepare for a period of meaningful work, one must first disappoint all those around them and lower all expectations before evolving themselves into someone they want to grow into. We all agree to not look back at 2020 right? Right? Like that bug with the year and stuff...let's band together and put a filter for history. "Why can't I access the 2020 files?" "Your vision out of focus fam"
83. Spending 3 days stressing for work you scramble to get done in 30 minutes & wondering how the order of magnitude guy does it and at the same time feeling bad for all my old bosses
84. After growing up too fast and trying to catch up on childhood, I'm still left puzzled as to why I feel like a Toms shoe thrown but too Big for me to fill
85. Wondering if quarter life is crisis is too elitist if it implies I intend on stretching this * out to 100. Like do 3rd world countries half 1/3 crisis and if so do they say repeating 3s & if so, how many 3s?
86. If we spend so much time trying to make life and the world better, when do we actually get to experience the better life? Can y'all stop trying to make the world better so we can all just collectively manage the state machine and align our shared understanding - and collectively sigh in happiness
87. Considering I'm the same age as the internet - if you start counting its 90s prime - I wonder what old people think of it? *kid scrolls on the tic tac & bird brain feed* "This * still writing stacks of text on the internet - old * fart" Sigh...listen here you little *
88. Wondering why people are so obsessed with letters and numbers. It's like they just wanna be successful to own numbers. At least be like the cool kids and dominate a pigment
89. I'm so out of focus I down sample my ADHD to be AD standard
90. How do you know if a girl is a local Ho'st? See if she says "I One Two go see Seven'ral people"
91. "Got any treble with the law young man?" Just a bunch of baseless accoust'ications about my gains and how I move the decib'mals because my case was a loss cause
92. If there's a Central Information Agency, how come we don't have a Central Data Agency?
93. Why can't the Central Information Agency allow the use of a PDA? Because public display of affection isn't covered under the hush budget
94. New model for car maker A-truck-tive, supporting All Will DD - denoting the independent drive suspension riding on the double drive shaft spinning in 6900 RPMs
95. How do you condition fast twitch muscle fibers? Ensure it's acupuncut'ual
96. Umm, hello?! "Very important; very pretentious"
97. Ever wonder what happens to new technology that society just isn't ready for? It walked out the door
98. Ever wonder what "* the El' off"'s new motivation is now that he's milked the sex joke and intellectual masterbation of EVs dry?
99. I would like to have her as a problem or a solution. Anything excerpt the demon in a dress. If this comes back to bite me, then "hey babe, I love you". Always gets you out of trouble. How much is a HBO subscription? Need to catch up on GoT....for research
100. I wonder if Lil Dicky is trying to beat me to a Sienfeld career run. I mean, I would start rapping but "I got energy; a whole lot of energy" bar is already taken
101. 80s and 21s
102. I have meaningful work that needs to be done. A career that needs to be built. An era that needs be refined. *Defeat animation splashes across the screen* sigh....Right now I'm stuck in ELO hell IRL
103. Someone: "What do you do these days?" Me: "Attempt a takedown of Twitter by migrating the world to raw text file memes and jokes publically open source. Better content and they will come. Just ask Disney+. I hear they're doing I'gerreaat"
104. Finding odd reminders you're a quarter of a century. A year before I felt like a butterfly out the cacoon. Now it's like my bones and muscles just decided it was time. At 18, everything i put in my mouth suddenly started appearing in my belly; weird phenomenon...At 28, God willing, I hope to grow a Dan B. beard, have a rich * laugh like "* the El' off" & "day 0" dudes. It's gotta come from the pit of the stomach. Like the kind of laugh where the breaths are so deep you turn to Bruce Lee after. Wait. *. Sigh...
105. Rapper name: Lil Bruce. Which? All 3
106. Musings about how great of a dad I'll make one day and then ask myself what's stopping me...*pauses GoT* sigh....
107. Wondering if I should have spent my early adulthood just watching Netflix instead of working. Then wondering if it would be my Netflix or if I'd be a leach if I wasn't spending that time working. I hate when someone says, "that's savings of $x a year". Stop. Stop. Stop. We're too young to be growing up this fast. Pause. Life = today. At worst, maybe the 1st and the 15th and whenever the baddies get refilled. Nothing more.
108. Thinking to myself what political career I would have had if I hadn't spent my life driving myself to my destiny living life to the fullest and making sure I spent every 2 year cycles depleting the hope and belief everyone around me had in me. *shrug* Could have made a great Parks & Rec staff lead
109. Getting anxious about how exciting it must be to be a headhunter at a tech company and hearing about this capable young man. You bounce from LinkedIn to GitHub and your eyes just pop. "Omg, come look at this" I intend on topping every list for next to the throne for the top tech companies. After every quarter, the CEOs will come to review the list and wonder wtf a kid is doing on there. By merit, I intend on being on top. I also intend on being so incredibly difficult and burdensome to hire as to antagonize every damn exec in the valley. I'll wear every hat. I'll master everything. I'll * do it all. I swear to it by 28, I intend on receiving offers from almost all of the top 25 tech companies. Let the games begin.
110. In other unrelated news: "nothing at all.." *hops into PJs* & *Bruno Mars cuts in...*
111. Finding out I'm not really a hard worker. In fact I hardly work. Moments of...whatever come...at random moments. I just ride the wave and hope no one finds out I spend the other 23 hours and 48 minutes of the day antagonizing over how much of a fraud I must be if I can't produce great work. Then spend 12 minutes in flow. I swear I always thought it was a joke that people were in the office. Like...what do you do here all day? *gulp* thankfully everyone just thought I was an intern so I got away with it
112. Recently came to terms with the fact that work is multi modal. Can't write about it? Talk about it. Can't talk about it? Well yeah, there's probably a reason. Draw about it and it gets drawn
113. You ever wonder...no...I'm not gonna be *that* guy
114. Wondering why I ever said "you or nothing". Grills? Hello? I'm a Christian and I would like to mingle. I haz swag, compassion, & am def def def going to be dependable if I you become "if" and I tell you it's "you or nothing". Wait. * me. No, you can't. You see the logic breaking down here? Is it too early to start an Ashley Maddison on GitHub? "Honey, wow I'm so proud of your commit streaks". They'll never get cought on this Hub. Even the private browsing is free without a monthly subscription. Someone ping Satya and get me some angel capital, keg, & some newly refined interaction patterns that actually adhere to the holding position of a phone and repeated use cases - we're going to swipe away Tinder's market share too
115. "So…what were YOU doing during the global criss of our generation?" Oh you know...just making sure I serve the world with my gifts and talents in case it - God forbid - gets the best of me. "Oh, you actualized your ability to move laterally and create upside like it was an egg yolk?" Yeah...something like that *commit* 
116. Asking for a friend: if you're on the right side of history, does that mean you avoided getting left behind?
117. Why was Facebook written in PHP? Mark was set on not using Go
118. Hey girl, I'm in in a wreck...I'm just a deconstructed knight in shining armor. Though you'll have to adhere to wearing blue light blocking glasses. And chivalry might be dead because only the strong survive; that's the other guy the weak-end - and I'm off to a strong-start. What do you say?
119. sk8 h8
120. Personalized voice mail mesaages for callers to share your status update. Paging Dr. Danger Zone
121. Water bottles, but without the bottle. Sell fridges of frozen water in the shape of a bottle. To drink, you insert a straw that heats up the water from the inside as you drag to sip. Heats the ice water to do on-sip purification. Option for cool water exists with 2nd filter. They sell ice today all the time so why not sell hot and ice water! At the end, you're left with nothing in your hand. 0 carbon footprint. Even the heated straw can be solar or even sun telescope powered. Say goodbye to plastic waste. Say hello to custom ice sculpture product brand deals
122. A society obsessed with ideas. I sh*t gold like this for breakfast

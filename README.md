It's back!

1. Left the lone star girl stranded like a DNA
2. Real silent G; like being well spoken was never allowed
3. Nice to meet you, I'm optimist's crime
4. No average cabbage, knees weak - spread, unread - flamed up ticker, take home bread 
5. Causing sickness like Teff. One is good bacteria and the other is a bad exterior causing mass hysteria like a class act filmed in your front lawn
7. My humility
8. The 50k+ students who accepted a C in like the 3rd problem set in a class teaching C
9. Getting pointers from a text book
10. Taking advantage of my home boy to pit him against Uncle Sam & brainwash idiologies of freedom and liberty to advance dark money untaxed XoXo
11. He didn't sleep with your girl on Valentine's. He was doing the ladies a favor. Yeah he pissed me off too.
12. No Rolls Royce deals for a rapper yet because they aleady Ghost wrote the whip
13. Slipped once so i split with her like Adam after she ribbed me the wrong way. Also on splits: tell kids you don't need to split crypto....you can already buy pieces of the asset. That's kind of the point behind stacking Sats...(Thanks Walter & kid!)
14. Rich people who are afraid to go to 0...wtf is the point of being rich then?
15. Black owned != Black Backed != Majority Ownership
16. Sipped up all my favorite liquidity. Called it a milk shakedown.
17. Feeling lucky but left out with no pals in my tier because the only 1 with 7 type game
18. Savage, the only essence of man. Musk couldn't produce musketeers so he cought a Tusk case
19. I would shoot for a Toyota brand deal but it won't be the first time I'd be going places I don't belong
20. Barcodes going out of style

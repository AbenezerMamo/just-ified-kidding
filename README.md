Bruh

It's back!

1. Left the lone star girl stranded like a DNA
2. Real silent G; like being well spoken was never allowed
3. Nice to meet you, I'm optimist's crime
4. No average cabbage, knees weak - spread, unread - flamed up ticker, take home bread 
5. Causing sickness like Teff. One is good bacteria and the other is a bad exterior causing mass hysteria like a class act filmed in your front lawn
7. My humility
8. The 50k+ students who accepted a C in like the 3rd problem set in a class teaching C
9. Getting pointers from a text book
10. Taking advantage of my home boy to pit him against Uncle Sam & brainwash idiologies of freedom and liberty to advance dark money untaxed XoXo
11. He didn't sleep with your girl on Valentine's. He was doing the ladies a favor. Yeah he pissed me off too.
12. No Rolls Royce deals for a rapper yet because they aleady Ghost wrote the whip
13. Slipped once so i split with her like Adam after she ribbed me the wrong way. Also on splits: tell kids you don't need to split crypto....you can already buy pieces of the asset. That's kind of the point behind stacking Sats...(Thanks Walter & kid!)
14. Rich people who are afraid to go to 0...wtf is the point of being rich then?
15. Black owned != Black Backed != Majority Ownership
16. Sipped up all my favorite liquidity. Called it a milk shakedown.
17. Feeling lucky but left out with no pals in my tier because the only 1 with 7 type game
18. Savage, the only essence of man. Musk couldn't produce musketeers so he cought a Tusk case
19. I would shoot for a Toyota brand deal but it won't be the first time I'd be going places I don't belong
20. Barcodes going out of style
21. Fearing assymetric wins for people out of fear they may bring us closer to flying cars, getting rid of diseases, & increasing the global longevity and prosperity in stylish innovation. How do we get to the sci-fi version of the future? Oh, just magically appear there with all of the old fart technology and ways of thinking; without any winners along the way that build and transition us there; and certainly by retaining control and iron grip on change, its enablers, and all of those who benfit from it. Society: you are backwards; get a clue 
22. What did she do? Broke the heart of God's favorite kid so she can go find a suitable partner to ask a Church for God's blesssing for her marriage so she may have a fruitful partnership in God's honor to produce children that could one day grow up to be model citizens of the world and generate bountiful blessings to share and spread God's grace, forgiveness, and blessings. This one gave me so much peace that I have rid myself of that * entirely in heart, mind, and soul. God's sense of humor is truly a blessing for me hahaa
23. What did they do? Rob him of the indepdent thinking, creative freedom, and intellectual courage so he can't champion it for the kids they so desire and reasssure will be rewarded when they grow up. In 3 lines, I just helped you calibrate your compass better than Apple's pervasive use of location and data in iOS. Disable data for Clock or I'll sue. Thanks.
24. Soup or salad? Nah, I'll get kryptonite greens instead - thanks. Dressing? I'm good; I can see right through
25. Thinking I would ever "let the b.s. get past me". Everybody [TBD] Abe soon to feature you in your very own episode narrated by Kevin Hart. Just gotta make sure he outlives me bc the team needs material and every moment is precious 
26. Thinking Hollywood would ever be allowed to make a penny on my name. In God bro, earnest.
27. Locking eyes with women and wondering why they all hate me
28. All the rich homies who insult a $38B market cap by getting every color but the sexy red. PSA: Alpha Romero & Masserratiiiii may be more than what meets the eye. Right Hyundaiiii & yota? Tsk tsk tsk
29. Teck Decks & model rocket engines - my childhood
30. Goodbye the following:
30. Punk rock, Real Madrid, TF2, Archer, weird corners of the internet, computer science, & everything and anything talent. I'll ruin it all. All of it. Pay back is a b.
31. Rowing. Grit. Changing locations.
32. Baseball. All of it.
33. Drowning in Chanel 30.
34. Everything that is managing fruit stands.
35. If your father is a pastor, stay away from me please.
36. M
37. Killing Floor
38. "Have I told you what me and my girl are doing this weekend" for everyone else
39. Those ads that light my day; anyday
40. Women who think it's funny to play games with me when I was a sweet young price. Now I'm an @; a *; a greeen candel; a thicc whiccc
41. Hello: My balls just popped; can you help me replace them?
42. Stick up the fine gram. Called in the igloot
43. Pike's peek. From my head to my heel toe. I can't even shift dawg. I like my speed in one gear. Trying to boost me a GT engine too. Just the tires i can't a Ford
44. Soft stick and a hardly spoken. Inverted power moves. Omh that's unholy of me.
45. This kid named Justin Der leading the youth. No joke I thought I was being trolled. Like, here I am on my stool thinking I'm doing social good enabling and kids out here serving it on a platter. Cheesy as sh*t but damn, good on you kid. I'm taking notes. Aye!
46. Me venturing out into the world trying to be Denice the Mennace and mayham as a havoc to society but ending up stumbling into opportunities to make the system better. Like wtf. Then slapped with the moral libra to either watch the world burn since I'm technically on vacation or to just do the social good equivlant of your cat across the hall locking eyes with you at the edge of the table with its pawn partially clasping the glass cup. With every breath you take and every fiber in your muscles clentching and relaxing, the glass just....*thomp* The paws hit the table in a Spacey CoD double tap. "Real meat *". Your jaws drop. The glass is shattered. So is your ego. The cat's stomach grumbles and you see the belly fat roll as it retreats back into its natural posititon and stretches forward with its @ hanging in the aid. *meow*. It rattles its body left and right in a fast pace - inching closer and closer to your still face. *lick* See, that only took 3 days. "Build a better habit - or you'll be the habitat." As it scurries away from your ear, you're simply left wondering how handsome Abe must be but why he's paid many pennies :)
47. (continued) Got people in the agency jelous I have so much agency and Gen Z thinking I'm agent Z but really I'm trying to cc my zzz
48. (continued) Optimist's crime - must have passed and just missed me - "saddest story ever told"
49. Girl who I'm determined to upset by striking out all her favorite players. Wait, wrong sport. A for effort. 5/5 like I'm Ab
50. c but Alkaline (to help her wash down candy shots)
51. To add or not to add. The sub zero substantive issue that is the cover in and out of the money - but never f*ck around money.
52. They say the greatest cars are all about hitting the break - not even gassed up
53. People talking b.s. about how stimulating I am because I'm Ethiopian - rich, black, and from the mother land. We gave you coffee; don't be disrespectful.
54. In other news, Ethiopian world star exports elevator music that is a hit your bed rock can't miss any shells on - to the left - and even - to the right!
55. "Attitude like * you - pay me" - feeling animated; like a car tune; v8 engine block - black boxed like a carton; hitting heel toe slides and dancin like Carlton; and bleedin fuel like a SR-71 canteen. I can't even. Chasing this money like "Katniss Everdeen" with world class talent that could be J.D. certified. "Stand up on the hood if it's that reel; dawg!"
56. * @ kids in Silicon Valley that can't even ship while my homies accepting charges and still putting out content even NPR is raveing about. "1st to the 1st". Black excellence is about to get redefined in our era bruh
57. Stack it up; and it's the strong start to the week
58. Don't wanna find out how fire smart my skull is; rascal with fiscal fixation; risk managed but Cat9 unhinged; utilize all my Howey to pipe all my C notes with Shear will of viscocity; WO but no woes for my varsity game all alone la carte for all the clicques in my city; move that chasity for the manacity; big Walter knocks for the Mitty blimp dream that gives her limp with full service creamed de crop both lips like a hot pick; round after round; relapse for her final lap; gluten to my wake up and never test me like a make up; in the room with hands out and hands like Ayeee for her A
59. Why can't you serve justice to bratty kids of French diplomats? Because their ple deal came with a Sil vu plais
60. How do you ensure diplomatic immunity doesn't run past its 5 year course? Give them a 4 year vest and throw them off a cliff
61. Which embassy gets the worst hospitality? The one Paris Hilton adores
62. Why am I comfortable being the #2 African entrepenuer? They ususally let the true African win the auction. Breaking race divisions because Elon can't be comfortable saying the N word. I say winning isn't everything but it's a good thing the prized winner is where real Negus come from. 3rd place? Always homies with them just in case I gotta tap em in. Never finish first is my kind of game and you know that's why Elon's got so many divorces. The other guy who was 1st for a while got rekt by splitting up his check probably by the same dude who helped him incorporate it. *imaginary hair flip* I was told one of these Negus might grow up to be businessmen that could one day not just rival the best but leave them in the dust. Truly, I'm #1 but I price them out of the market efficently by racing to 0, where it counts. One is pissed that I'm scared of the light and the other wishes I had to fear my * pics would get leaked. Though all 3 of us belive in taking it to the grave b/c the 1% people giving away 99% seem kinda sketch. The one who stayed at the top the longest still can't manage to give more than 1% without...nvm. Well read now firing up the Kindle for all their silly cons as their race to build the valley on Sandy Hill. Damn. Damn. Damn. Wondering why they don't wana be friends? One rejected my scholarship application. The other rejected me on the 1st round as a PM. The other is just salty I rejected AWS for SNAP money to cash in my Snapple facts. The one who dispises me the most invites me to interview for Sr. PM positions with his execs just to fail me on the leadership question: "describe a situation in how you resolved conflict with a teammate." But really they're all pissed they couldn't hire the 1 PM who can lead without influence or authority. Binded my own port but can't complain that my IP never got hurt. Lastly, one smiled for trying to get laid. The other is too obsessed with smiling. The other is pissed that the other clown can smile but he's forced to hide his runoff schemes under "Senator...." :) Literally, can't even come close. How did I pay it forward for all the lessons they helped me escape? Antagonize them. Day after day after day. I'm good where I'm at. Wei Good but never tried to weigh what's good. The other is in your neighborhood and the other can't even tell you what's under the hood and the real gentlemen got there with intel under the hood. *whew*
63. Feenin left out; bites all right
64. Tatt'd up swivel; fed up with the greens from my estate; inner joint and db spiked with hashes until its cached up to ashes and the primary kief in case the job need brief
65. Fair split. Forgot why but it added up at some point
66. 00113636 smile but the hi didn't live down so the grievances remained distant for all to meet her in every instance; real tense - never passed. Wasn't fair but never is for @ present who can't catch on to the assymetry - weight heavy for all those who dispised, tons
67. New day; fresh cent; now trying to copp the whole 30's; get my CD to play me DiViDends; and my quarters to be in the 1st quartile
68. Money looking triangle and makes that sound too because I'm tired of Square & Circle running the game. It ain't friendly so I need you to sign the check on this X here. I long for that short squeeze (carry the Ez please) baby
69. Minted
70. I like my valuation in ex ante change
